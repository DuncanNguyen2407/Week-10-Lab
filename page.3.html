	<h1>Pho Ta Hien </h1>
	<p> Beer Street is simply the quintessential nightlife spot in Hanoi for locals, backpackers, flashpackers, and holidaymakers alike. It’s a street lined with fresh kegs of beer, where people from all over the world flock to sit on colourful tiny plastic stools at tiny plastic tables that spill out onto the pavements. The beer here is also one of the cheapest beers in the world. At only 5,000 vnd ($0.21) – 10,000 vnd ($0.42) per cup, you can easily have one of the best night’s out in Hanoi for less than $5.</p>
